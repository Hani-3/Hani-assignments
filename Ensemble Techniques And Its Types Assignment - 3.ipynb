    "Random Forest Regressor is a supervised learning algorithm used for regression tasks. It's an ensemble method that combines predictions from multiple decision trees to produce a more accurate and robust final prediction. This approach leverages the strengths of individual decision trees while mitigating their weaknesses, particularly their tendency to overfit."

    "Random Forest Regressor employs two key strategies to combat overfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bootstrap Aggregation (Bagging): During training, random subsets (bootstrap samples) are created from the original data with replacement. Each decision tree in the forest is trained on a unique bootstrap sample. This injects diversity into the ensemble, preventing the trees from memorizing the training data too closely.\n",
    "- Random Feature Selection: At each node of a decision tree, instead of considering all features for splitting, only a random subset of features (typically the square root of the total number of features) is evaluated as potential splitting criteria. This further reduces the chance of overfitting by limiting the trees' focus to a smaller set of features at each split."

    "- Aggregation Process: The predictions from all individual trees are aggregated to produce the final prediction. In most cases, the aggregation method used is simple averaging, where the final prediction is the average of all the predictions made by the individual trees.\n",
    "- Final Output: The final output of the Random Forest Regressor is the aggregated prediction, which represents the ensemble's consensus prediction for the target variable based on the input features. This aggregated prediction tends to be more robust and less prone to overfitting compared to the prediction of any individual tree."
