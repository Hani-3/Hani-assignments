    "Different methods used for Web Scraping:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Manual Copy-Pasting:\n",
    "The simplest method involves manually copying and pasting data from a website into a local file or spreadsheet. While this is straightforward, it is not practical for large-scale data extraction and is limited to small amounts of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regular Expressions:\n",
    "Regular expressions (regex) are powerful pattern-matching tools used to extract specific data patterns from HTML or other markup languages. While effective for simple cases, regex can become complex and error-prone when dealing with more intricate web page structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "- HTML Parsing using Libraries:\n",
    "Web scraping libraries like BeautifulSoup (for Python), lxml, and jsoup (for Java) provide a convenient way to parse HTML and XML documents. These libraries create a navigable tree structure, making it easier to locate and extract specific elements or data from a webpage.\n",
    "\n",
    "- XPath and CSS Selectors:\n",
    "XPath and CSS selectors are methods for navigating the HTML document structure to locate and extract specific elements. XPath is particularly powerful and allows for precise targeting of elements based on their path in the document. CSS selectors are commonly used for styling web pages but can also be applied for scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Headless Browsers:\n",
    "Headless browsers like Puppeteer (for JavaScript) and Selenium (for multiple languages) automate the interaction with websites. These tools allow for dynamic rendering and interaction with JavaScript-based content. They can be helpful when dealing with websites that load content dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "- APIs:\n",
    "Some websites provide APIs that allow developers to access and retrieve data in a structured format. Using APIs is often the most ethical and efficient way to obtain data from a website since it involves interacting with the site in a way that is intended by the owners.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Web Scraping Frameworks:\n",
    "There are several web scraping frameworks and tools that combine various methods to simplify the scraping process. Examples include Scrapy (for Python), Octoparse, and import.io. These frameworks often provide a higher level of abstraction, making it easier to define scraping rules and handle common challenges."

    "Flask is used in this web scraping project for several reasons:\n",
    "- Web Application Interface: Flask provides a simple and lightweight web application framework, making it easy to create a user interface for interacting with the web scraping functionality. This is beneficial for users who want to initiate and control the scraping process through a web interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Routing and URL Handling: Flask simplifies URL routing, allowing for the creation of clean and user-friendly URLs. This is particularly useful when designing an interface for users to input parameters or access specific functionalities of the web scraping application.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Integration with MongoDB and API Development: Flask seamlessly integrates with MongoDB and facilitates the creation of RESTful APIs. This is advantageous in a web scraping project where data is collected and stored in a MongoDB database, and an API is created for easy retrieval of the scraped information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lightweight and Flexible: Flask is a micro-framework that is lightweight and easy to set up. It provides flexibility in choosing components, allowing developers to use only what is needed for a specific project. This is ideal for smaller projects like web scraping applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ease of Learning and Deployment: Flask is known for its simplicity and ease of learning. It has a minimalistic design that allows developers to get started quickly. Additionally, deploying Flask applications is straightforward, making it a practical choice for projects of various scales.\n",
