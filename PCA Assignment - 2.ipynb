    "In the context of PCA (Principal Component Analysis), a projection refers to the transformation of data from a higher-dimensional space to a lower-dimensional subspace while preserving the maximum amount of variance.

    "- Covariance Matrix Calculation: First, PCA computes the covariance matrix of the original data. The covariance matrix quantifies the relationships between different dimensions or features in the dataset.\n",
    "- Eigenvalue Decomposition: PCA then performs eigenvalue decomposition or singular value decomposition (SVD) on the covariance matrix. This step results in a set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues.\n",
    "- Selection of Principal Components: The eigenvectors represent the principal components, and the corresponding eigenvalues indicate the amount of variance explained by each principal component. PCA selects the eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues, as these eigenvectors capture the directions of maximum variance in the data.\n",
    "- Projection of Data: Finally, PCA projects the original data onto the selected principal components. This projection transforms the data from the original high-dimensional space to a lower-dimensional subspace defined by the principal components.\n",
