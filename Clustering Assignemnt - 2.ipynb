    "Hierarchical clustering is a method of clustering data points into a hierarchy of clusters. Unlike partitioning algorithms like K-means, hierarchical clustering does not require the number of clusters to be specified in advance. Instead, it creates a tree-like structure of clusters, known as a dendrogram, which can be cut at different levels to obtain clusters of varying sizes.\n",

    "The main difference between hierarchical clustering and other clustering techniques lies in its approach to clustering. Hierarchical clustering builds a nested hierarchy of clusters, whereas other techniques typically assign each data point to a single cluster. Additionally, hierarchical clustering can be agglomerative (bottom-up) or divisive (top-down), allowing for flexibility in the clustering process."

    "- Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (Bottom-Up): This method starts by treating each data point as a separate cluster. In each step, it merges the two closest clusters based on a distance metric, forming a new cluster. This process continues until all data points belong to a single cluster.\n",
    "- Divisive Hierarchical Clustering (Top-Down): Here, all data points begin in one cluster. With each step, the cluster with the highest \"within-cluster distance\" (dissimilarity between its members) is split into two sub-clusters. This continues until each cluster contains only one data point."

Additionally, post-processing techniques such as silhouette analysis or density-based outlier detection can be applied to further refine the identification of outliers."
