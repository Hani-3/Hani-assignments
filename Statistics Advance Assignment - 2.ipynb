    "The cumulative distribution function (CDF) is a function that describes the probability that a random variable will be less than or equal to a specific value. It's a cumulative function because it adds up the total likelihood up to that point.\n",

    "Uses:\n",
    "- The CDF provides a comprehensive summary of the probability distribution of a random variable, helping us understand the likelihood of various outcomes.\n",
    "- It simplifies the calculation of probabilities for ranges of values by integrating probabilities up to a certain point.\n",
    "- CDFs are commonly used in hypothesis testing, risk assessment, and decision-making processes to evaluate the probabilities associated with different events or outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, If i am working on data of electron density from satellites so i will use cumulative density function to see outcomes because this type of data does not follow any pattern but when i want to see changes in this randomly up down data then cumulative sunction can help. It adds values and if there is specific changes than i can notice easily with incresed slop in plot."

    "The normal distribution is a common probability distribution that has a \"bell curve\" shape. The two main parameters of a normal distribution are the mean and standard deviation. These parameters determine the shape and probabilities of the distribution. The mean of a normal distribution represents its center or average value. It defines the location of the peak of the distribution, known as the mode.  A smaller standard deviation indicates that the data points are clustered closely around the mean, resulting in a narrower and taller distribution. Conversely, a larger standard deviation leads to a broader and flatter distribution, indicating greater variability in the data."

    "The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) holds immense significance in statistics by providing a robust framework for inference and analysis. Its assurance that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution, regardless of the shape of the population distribution, enables researchers to make valid inferences about population parameters. This foundational theorem underpins various statistical techniques, from hypothesis testing to confidence interval estimation, making it indispensable in fields such as finance, epidemiology, and quality control. Moreover, the CLT guides decisions on sample size determination, ensuring reliable estimates of population parameters. Its practical application and theoretical underpinnings make the Central Limit Theorem an invaluable tool in statistical modeling and inference, facilitating informed decision-making in diverse domains."
