    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used to encode categorical variables based on the target variable. It assigns ordinal ranks to categories based on the mean of the target variable for each category. This encoding can be useful when there is a relationship between the categorical variable and the target variable, and you want to capture this relationship in the encoding.\n",

    "- Relationship between variables: Covariance helps in understanding the relationship between two variables. A high covariance indicates a strong relationship, while a low covariance indicates a weak relationship.\n",
