    "Multiple linear regression is an extension of simple linear regression that allows for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables. In simple linear regression, there is only one independent variable, whereas in multiple linear regression, there are two or more independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how multiple linear regression differs from simple linear regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Number of Independent Variables:\n",
    "   - Simple Linear Regression: In simple linear regression, there is only one independent variable (predictor).\n",
    "   - Multiple Linear Regression: In multiple linear regression, there are two or more independent variables (predictors).\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Interpretation of Coefficients:\n",
    "   - Simple Linear Regression: In simple linear regression, the slope coefficient $ \\theta_1$ represents the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the independent variable.\n",
    "   - Multiple Linear Regression: In multiple linear regression, each slope coefficient $theta_1, \\theta_2, \\ldots, \\theta_n $ represents the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the corresponding independent variable, while holding all other independent variables constant.\n",

    "Multicollinearity occurs in multiple linear regression when two or more independent variables (predictor variables) are highly correlated with each other. This essentially means that one variable can be predicted to a large extent by another variable(s) in the model.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Unreliable Coefficient Estimates: It becomes difficult to isolate the individual effect of each independent variable on the dependent variable (response variable). The coefficients of the regressors become inflated and can swing wildly with small changes to the model, making them statistically insignificant.\n",
    "- Reduced Model Precision: The variance of the coefficient estimates increases, leading to wider confidence intervals. This makes it harder to determine the true relationship between the independent and dependent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Detection of Multicollinearity:\n",
    "- Correlation Matrix: Examining the correlation matrix between all independent variables. High correlations (values close to 1 or -1) indicate potential multicollinearity.\n",
    "- Variance Inflation Factor (VIF): This diagnostic measure calculates how much the variance of an estimated coefficient is inflated due to multicollinearity. A VIF value greater than 5 or 10 suggests a potential problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Addressing Multicollinearity:\n",
    "- Data Collection: If possible, gather additional data that reduces the correlation between variables.\n",
    "- Dimensionality Reduction Techniques: Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can be used to create new, uncorrelated variables from the existing ones.\n",
    "- Dropping a Variable: If a variable has a very high correlation with another and doesn't hold significant meaning for the analysis, it can be dropped from the model (be cautious with this approach).\n",

Unlike linear regression, which assumes a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables, polynomial regression allows for more flexible and nonlinear relationships to be captured.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how polynomial regression differs from linear regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Functional Form:\n",
    "   - Linear Regression: In linear regression, the relationship between the independent and dependent variables is assumed to be linear, meaning the relationship can be represented by a straight line equation (e.g., $y = mx + b$).\n",
    "   - Polynomial Regression: In polynomial regression, the relationship between the independent and dependent variables is modeled using a polynomial equation of degree $n$. The equation takes the form:\n",
    "     $y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times x + \\beta_2 \\times x^2 + \\ldots + \\beta_n \\times x^n + \\epsilon$\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Model Complexity:\n",
    "   - Linear Regression: Linear regression models are relatively simple and have fewer parameters to estimate, making them easier to interpret.\n",
    "   - Polynomial Regression: Polynomial regression models can capture more complex relationships between variables, especially when the relationship is nonlinear. However, higher-order polynomial models can become increasingly complex and prone to overfitting, especially with limited data.\n",

    "3. Flexibility:\n",
    "   - Linear Regression: Linear regression assumes a constant rate of change between the independent and dependent variables.\n",
    "   - Polynomial Regression: Polynomial regression allows for more flexibility in capturing nonlinear relationships, as it can fit curves of different shapes and degrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Bias-Variance Tradeoff:\n",
    "   - Linear Regression: Linear regression tends to have lower variance but may suffer from higher bias if the relationship between variables is nonlinear.\n",
