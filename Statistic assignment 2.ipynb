    "- **Mean:** The mean is also known as the average. it is calculated by adding up all the values in the dataset and then dividing by the total number of values. The mean is sensitive to outliers, meaning that extreme values can significantly influence its value.\n",
    "- **Median:** The median is the middle value of a dataset when the values are arranged in ascending or descending order. If there is sn even number of values, the median is the middle one. If there is an odd number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values. The median is less affected by outliers compared to the mean, making it a better measure of central tendency for skewed datasets.\n",
    "- **Mode:** The mode is the value that appears most frequently in the dataset. A dataset can have one mode (unimodal), two modes (bimodal), or more (multimodal). Unlike the mean and median, the mode can be used for both numerical and categorical data. The mode is particularly useful for categorical data where there is no inherent ordering of values."

For example, if a dataset cantains values 1,3,5,7 and 9, the variance is 8.\n",

It measures the average deviation of data points from the mean and is expressed in the same units as the original data.
