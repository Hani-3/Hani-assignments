    "Limitations of Accuracy as a Sole Metric:\n",
    "- Class Imbalance: If one class has significantly more data points than others, a model might achieve high accuracy by simply predicting the majority class most of the time. This can be misleading if the model performs poorly on the minority class, which might be the class of greater interest.\n",
    "- Cost-Sensitivity: In some applications, misclassifications can have different costs. For example, in medical diagnosis, a false negative (missing a disease) might be much worse than a false positive (mistaking a healthy person for sick). Accuracy doesn't capture these cost differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Addressing the Limitations:\n",
    "- Multiple Metrics: Use a combination of metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC (Area Under the ROC Curve) to gain a more comprehensive picture of performance.\n",
    "- Cost-Sensitive Learning: Modify the learning algorithm to consider the cost of different misclassifications. This can incentivize the model to prioritize correct predictions for classes with higher costs.\n",
    "- Stratification: When dealing with imbalanced data, consider splitting the data into training and testing sets that maintain the class distribution present in the real-world data. This ensures the model is evaluated on a representative sample.\n",
