    "- Define the Hyperparameter Grid: Specify a grid of hyperparameters that you want to search over. This grid represents all the possible combinations of hyperparameters you want to try.\n",
    "- Cross-validation: Split your dataset into multiple subsets (folds). For each combination of hyperparameters, perform k-fold cross-validation. This involves splitting the dataset into k subsets, training the model on k-1 subsets, and evaluating it on the remaining subset. This process is repeated k times, with each subset used as the validation set exactly once.\n",
    "- Model Training and Evaluation: For each combination of hyperparameters and each fold, train the model on the training portion of the data and evaluate it on the validation portion.\n",
    "- Performance Metric: Calculate the performance metric (e.g., accuracy, F1-score) for each combination of hyperparameters based on the average performance across all folds.\n",
    "- Select Best Hyperparameters: Identify the combination of hyperparameters that yielded the best performance metric.\n",
    "- Model Training on Full Dataset: Optionally, you can train the model using the best hyperparameters on the entire dataset (training + validation) to get the final model."

    "Data leakage creates a false sense of confidence in the model's ability to perform well. Here's how:\n",
    "- Overfitting: The model learns patterns specific to the training data, including the leakage, which may not be present in new data. This leads to overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data.\n",

    "- Imagine you're building a model to predict customer churn (cancelling a subscription). Ideally, the model should rely on features like customer usage history and demographics. Data leakage could occur if the training data accidentally includes the actual churn label (cancelled or not) for each customer. The model would then simply learn to identify this label and wouldn't actually learn from the other features. This would lead to a model with high accuracy on the training data, but it wouldn't be able to predict churn for new customers because it never learned from the relevant features."
