    "Decision tree classifier is a popular machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by recursively partitioning the input space into smaller regions based on the feature values. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tree Construction: The decision tree starts with the entire dataset at the root node. It then selects the best feature to split the data based on some criterion, such as Gini impurity or information gain. The dataset is partitioned into subsets based on the chosen feature's values.\n",
    "- Recursive Splitting: This process is repeated recursively for each subset at each node. At each step, the algorithm selects the best feature to split the data, creating child nodes. This splitting continues until one of the stopping criteria is met, such as maximum depth reached, minimum samples per leaf, or no further improvement in impurity reduction.\n",
    "- Leaf Nodes: Once the splitting process is complete, the final nodes of the tree are called leaf nodes or terminal nodes. These nodes represent the predicted class or value for the instances that fall into that region.\n",
    "- Prediction: To make a prediction for a new instance, it traverses the tree from the root node down to a leaf node. At each node, it follows the appropriate branch based on the feature value of the instance being classified. Once it reaches a leaf node, the class label assigned to that leaf node is the predicted class for the instance."

    "Step-by-step explanation of the mathematical intuition behind decision tree classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Splitting Criteria: Decision trees use a splitting criterion to determine the best feature and value to split the data at each node. Common criteria include Gini impurity and information gain (e.g., using Shannon entropy). These criteria quantify the impurity or disorder in the dataset. The goal is to find splits that result in the purest subsets possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Gini Impurity: Gini impurity measures the probability of incorrectly classifying a randomly chosen element if it were randomly labeled according to the distribution of labels in the subset. Mathematically, for a node with $ K $ classes, the Gini impurity $ G $ is calculated as:\n",
    "$ G = 1 - \\sum_{i=1}^{K} p_i^2 $\n",
    "where $ p_i $ is the probability of class $ i $ in the node.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Information Gain: Information gain measures the reduction in entropy or uncertainty achieved by splitting the data on a particular feature. Entropy, denoted as $ H $, quantifies the randomness or disorder in the dataset. For a binary classification problem, entropy is calculated as:\n",
    "$ H = -p_+ \\log_2(p_+) - p_- \\log_2(p_-) $\n",
    "where $ p_+ $ and $ p_- $ are the probabilities of the positive and negative classes, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Choosing the Best Split: The decision tree algorithm evaluates all possible splits for each feature and selects the one that maximizes information gain or minimizes impurity. This process is repeated recursively for each subset until a stopping criterion is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Stopping Criteria: Decision trees continue splitting until certain stopping criteria are met, such as reaching a maximum depth, minimum number of samples per leaf, or no further improvement in impurity reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Prediction: Once the tree is constructed, prediction for a new instance involves traversing the tree from the root node down to a leaf node based on the feature values of the instance. At each node, the algorithm follows the appropriate branch based on the feature value and repeats this process until it reaches a leaf node. The class label assigned to the leaf node is the predicted class for the instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "By recursively partitioning the feature space based on these mathematical principles, decision trees can efficiently classify data into different classes."

This can lead to regions that are not optimal in terms of separating different classes, especially in cases where the decision boundary should be more complex.\n",

Each hyper-rectangle corresponds to a region in which the decision tree predicts a specific class label. The decision boundaries between these hyper-rectangles are perpendicular to the feature axes, resulting in a series of axis-aligned splits."
