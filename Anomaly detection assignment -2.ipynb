    "Feature selection plays a critical role in anomaly detection for several reasons:\n",
    "- Improving Accuracy: By selecting the most relevant features, feature selection can enhance the accuracy of the anomaly detection model. Irrelevant or redundant features can obscure important patterns and lead to poor detection performance.\n",
    "- Reducing Dimensionality: High-dimensional data can lead to the \"curse of dimensionality,\" making it difficult to detect anomalies due to the sparse nature of the data. Feature selection reduces dimensionality, helping algorithms to perform better.\n",
    "- Enhancing Interpretability: Selected features often make the model more interpretable, allowing for a better understanding of why certain instances are considered anomalies.\n",
    "- Reducing Overfitting: By eliminating irrelevant features, feature selection helps prevent the model from overfitting to noise in the training data, leading to better generalization on unseen data.\n",
    "- Improving Computational Efficiency: With fewer features, the computational complexity of the anomaly detection process is reduced, leading to faster and more efficient model training and prediction."
