    "- Partitioning Algorithms: These algorithms partition data into distinct groups without overlapping. K-means is a popular example of a partitioning algorithm.\n",
    "- Hierarchical Algorithms: These algorithms create a tree of clusters, where each node represents a cluster that is a merge of its children. Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering and Divisive Hierarchical Clustering are examples.\n",
    "- Density-based Algorithms: These algorithms group together points that are closely packed together, forming high-density regions separated by low-density regions. DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a widely-used density-based algorithm.\n",
    "- Grid-based Algorithms: These algorithms partition the data space into a finite number of cells that form a grid-like structure, which is then used to perform clustering. STING (Statistical Information Grid) and WaveCluster are examples.\n",
    "- Model-based Algorithms: These algorithms assume that the data is generated by a mixture of underlying probability distributions and attempt to find the parameters of these distributions. Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) fall into this category.\n",
    "\n",
    "The differences among these algorithms lie in their underlying assumptions about the data distribution, their scalability to large datasets, their sensitivity to noise and outliers, and their ability to handle clusters of varying shapes and sizes."
